# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Even though we specify pixels in terms of (x, y)-coordinates,
# when it comes to writing code, we access the individual pixel values as image[y, x] .
# Why does the y-coordinate come first?
# Well, keep in mind that an image is defined as a matrix.
# We define a matrix in terms of number of rows and number of columns.
# Therefore, to access an individual pixel located at (x, y),
# we first supply y, the row number, followed by x, the column number
# this is by far the most common mistake I see when first getting started with OpenCV,
# so be sure to keep this in mind.
